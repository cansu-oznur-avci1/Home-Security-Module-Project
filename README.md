# üè† Home Security & Monitoring System

This project presents the design and simulation of a **Home Security and Monitoring System** using two different approaches:  

1. **Digital Logic Circuit Design** (RC filters, 555 timer, Schmitt triggers, flip-flops, encoders/decoders, 7-segment display)  
2. **Microcontroller-based System** (Arduino Uno, keypad, LCD, embedded C code)  

The system detects unauthorized entry via **door and window sensors**, and triggers a visual alarm when intrusion occurs. A keypad-based password mechanism is also included for secure arming/disarming.

## üîß Setup & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cansu-oznur-avci1/Home-Security-Module-Project.git
   ```

2. For the **Digital Logic Design**:  
   - Open Proteus simulation files.  
   - Run the circuit and test door/window switches.  

3. For the **Arduino Design**:  
   - Upload `module-project-micro-code.ino` to Arduino Uno.  
   - Connect LCD, keypad, and switches as described.  
   - Run Proteus simulation or real hardware setup.

## üìä Results & Observations

- Both implementations successfully detect intrusion and activate alarms.  
- The **logic circuit** demonstrates fundamental digital system design principles.  
- The **Arduino version** provides flexibility, easier modifications, and password-protected access.  

**Future Improvements:**
- Add buzzer for audible alarms.  
- GSM/Wi-Fi module for remote SMS/email notifications.  
- More sensors (motion, fire, gas) for extended monitoring.
